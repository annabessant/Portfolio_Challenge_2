# Portfolio_Challenge_2

## Description

As a starting point, I took Challenge One starter and adopted HTML structure for portfolio by changing all the images, links, headings. In doing so:  
Now, when the page is loaded the page presents my name, a recent photo, and links to sections all about me;
Now, when one of the links in the navigation is clicked then the UI scrolls to the corresponding section;
Now, when viewing the section about my work then the section contains titled images of my ‘applications’ (projects / areas of interest introduced in About Me section);
Now, when images of the applications are clicked then the user is taken to that deployed application;
Now, when the page is resized or viewed on various screens and devices then the layout is responsive and adapts to my viewport
